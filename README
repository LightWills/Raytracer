Simple ray tracer in C, mostly used for benchmarking. Supports multi threading.

Compiling: running 'make' on a Unix/Linux/BSD platform should do. It only needs pthreads and math library.

Running: 
	Normal: ./raytrace scene.txt
	With 3D object: ./raytrace scene.txt spaceship.3ds 
this last one will render a spaceship, using the 3ds loader.
